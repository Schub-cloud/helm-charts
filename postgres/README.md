# Postgres Cluster

This helm chart creates an instance of PostgresCluster crd from Crunchy Data postgres operator. It is vendored because it is not available in a helm repository.

To upgrade this go to the [Git Repo](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator-examples/tree/main/helm/postgres) and copy the folder.

If they publish this in a git repo this can be deleted and all references should move to the public repository.
